# CogCMS

A self-hostable, multi-site headless CMS built with Next.js 16, React 19, MongoDB/Mongoose, TypeScript and Vitest. Manage blogs, authors, FAQs, whitepapers and release notes in one editorial workspace, and deliver published content to your websites through a versioned API or restricted MongoDB views.

The CMS includes site-scoped users and API keys, editorial previews, stored blog rendering, signed publishing notifications, newsletter and FAQ intake, and optional S3 media uploads. Websites own their presentation. Start with the local demo below or [set up your own installation](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Local setup

Use Node 22 (`.nvmrc`), npm, **MongoDB 8.2.5** and MongoDB Shell (`mongosh`) for this local recipe. The CMS requires a replica set for transactional paths. Media upload is optional and disabled when the three `S3_*` values are unset.

Get the source and enter the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mundra-aman/CogCMS.git
cd CogCMS
```

Then complete these steps from that directory:

1. Create an empty local data directory and start MongoDB with `mongod --replSet rs0 --bind_ip 127.0.0.1 --port 27017 --dbpath <empty-local-directory>`. In a second terminal, connect with `mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017` and run `rs.initiate({_id: 'rs0', members: [{_id: 0, host: 'localhost:27017'}]})` once. Do not point these commands at a shared database.
2. Run `npm ci`, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, and set a new local `CMS_JWT_SECRET` (at least 32 characters) and local `CMS_SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (at least 12 characters). The example email is fictional. Keep `MONGODB_DB_NAME=cms_public_demo` and `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0`.
3. Run `npm run seed:admin`, `npm run ensure:indexes`, then `npm run seed:demo`. The demo seed refuses remote MongoDB targets, any database name other than `cms_public_demo`, and an existing site or blog. It creates two fictional sites and 48 blogs; it never overwrites existing records.
4. Run `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3003/admin/login`. Sign in with the local admin, then choose **Northstar Studio** or **Harbor Notes** from the site selector. Explore the editors or create a site of your own. The demo has no public website, so its public View links are illustrative.

To reset, stop the app and verify that the target is your disposable local `cms_public_demo` database before dropping it with `mongosh`; then repeat the seed commands. No reset command is bundled so a copied command cannot silently erase another database.

## Checks

Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` sequentially. Unit and integration tests use a separate temporary MongoDB replica set. If its binary is not cached, `mongodb-memory-server` may download one. Report any setup or baseline failure separately from your changes.

## AI writing assistant (optional)

The blog editor's **AI assist** button opens a panel with an **AI-readiness score** and suggestions for **titles**, **meta descriptions** and **FAQs**. The score (0–100, with a checklist of fixes) measures how easily answer engines such as ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google AI Overviews can understand, quote and cite a post. It is calculated in the browser as you write and needs no key.

Suggestions come from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai). To turn them on, create a free key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys), set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env` and restart `npm run dev`. By default it tries two free models that tested well, then OpenRouter's free router; set `OPENROUTER_MODELS` to choose your own. Free models are shared and best-effort, so answers usually take 2–30 seconds and sometimes need a retry. Editors review every suggestion and apply it with one click; nothing is saved until they save the post. Generating sends the draft to OpenRouter and the model's provider, so read the privacy notes before using it with confidential drafts. See [AI writing assistant](docs/AI_ASSISTANT.md) for the design, the scoring checks, the API and limitations.

## Boundaries

- Admin routes use a login session and active-site selection. `/api/v1` uses site-scoped keys and exposes published content only.
- Website rendering stays in the consumer; this repository owns editorial UI, content models and publication contracts. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
- Local editorial use needs no cloud account or paid service. Optional media and hosted installations use your own resources. See [deployment notes](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).
- Keep credentials out of the repository. `.env.example` contains placeholders only.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute. The optional [assignment](ASSIGNMENT.md) provides a bounded example contribution; it does not define the scope of the product.
